**Description**:
Picturesque Mountain View is a peaceful scene featuring a serene mountain landscape with a flowing river, cozy houses, a tree, and a charming windmill. The scene transitions between day and night based on user input, with the daytime revealing vibrant colors and the nighttime casting a serene, moonlit glow over the landscape.

**Features**:
- **Day/Night Cycle**: Pressing the arrow up key transitions the scene to daytime, while pressing the arrow down key shifts it to nighttime.

- **Dynamic Environment**: The windmill blades rotate gently, adding a touch of life to the tranquil landscape.

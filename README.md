**Project Name**: Picturesque Mountain View: Interactive Nature Scene

**Description**:
Picturesque Mountain View is a peaceful scene featuring a serene mountain landscape with a flowing river, cozy houses, a tree, and a charming windmill. The scene transitions between day and night based on user input, with the daytime revealing vibrant colors and the nighttime casting a serene, moonlit glow over the landscape.

**Features**:
